The sensor I originally went with I believe has failed. I get a reading of 97% Humidity when the soil feels dry. After watering (and possibly overwater) the sensor does not move much if at all. Need to conduct more testing.

##### Some notes are embeded in the arduino coding itself so you can follow along there.
The seesaw library is used for a shield or breakout board for specific purposes that I do not understand or care to. 
I am re-writing the code to work directly with the sensor. Also changing the code for the RGB LED to produce a purple/magenta light to stimulate plant growth.

Before I could even test the previous branch I thought why not change the code to allow for two different color LEDs one RED one BLUE
