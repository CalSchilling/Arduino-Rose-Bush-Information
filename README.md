##### Some notes are embeded in the arduino coding itself so you can follow along there.
The seesaw library is used for a shield or breakout board for specific purposes that I do not understand or care to. 
I am re-writing the code to work directly with the sensor. Also changing the code for the RGB LED to produce a purple/magenta light to stimulate plant growth.
